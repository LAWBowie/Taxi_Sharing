# Taxi Sharing App
- I undertook this project as part of my University coursework.
- Implemented key aspects of business logic for a proposed taxi-sharing application, designed for deployment as a Cordova app on Android devices. Utilizing a provided REST API, I was able to handle all the necessary persistence and storage requirements of the app.
